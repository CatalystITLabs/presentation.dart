presentation.dart
=================

Presentation framework using css3 3d animations in dart.
See the presentation.dart demo at http://stephenlujan.github.io/presentation.dart/example/demo.html 
It works with Chrome, but firefox gets thrown off during rotations, and IE fails 3d effects completely.

Inspired by http://bartaz.github.com/impress.js/
Thanks!
